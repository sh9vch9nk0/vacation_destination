# Vacation Destination Wish List Project

## A simple web application that allows you to add possible vacation destination points you might want to visit. As the user adds locations into the form, cards are added on the right sode of the window. The card will provide a button that will allow the user to remove the card from the list, if they want to. Also, if no image URL is provided, a generic image will be supplied.
